# What is this?
This WebApi Client is automatically generated by the build process for this project, based on the values in files within the OpenAPIs folder.
The idea behind this is that the client can be auto generated by the service creators (automated or otherwise) and then published to Nuget, allowing clients to quickly be able to use this API and not have to maintain their own clients and DTO models.

# Note
The client is generated from the JSON swagger documents in the OpenAPISs folder. If the interface to the WebApi is changed, the corresponding swagger doc should be updated to make the generated client reflect the changes.
